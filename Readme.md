# Purpose
There's some things I find myself clicking a lot for, and I want to click less. This is a burgeoning collection of python scripts designed to make me click less, that I think are a little too complicated for a hypothetically terrible terminal command.

## Image Sort
This is to sort images, first with folders, and then with tags, into categories, based on a given set of dimensions and tolerances for categories.
